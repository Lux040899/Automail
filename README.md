# SWEN30006 Project 1 - Robomail Revision
## Canvas Instructions
Please read [the attached pdf](SWEN30006_Project1_spec.pdf) carefully, and use the discussion forum if you have questions.

[The attached zip file](P1_Automail_v1.0.zip) is an Eclipse archive ready for you to import.

You can use [this report template](P1ReportTemplate.docx) for the report component of your submission.

See [this post on Working as a Team](https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/5543/modules/288827) for important information about work allocation and dealing with non-contributing team members.

Details on how to submit will appear closer to the deadline.

Note:
This project uses content from lectures up to and including week 5, and workshops up to and including workshop 5 (esp. GRASP and refactoring).

You and your team should commence the project immediately, but should not attempt to finalise the project until you have covered the above content.

Please remember that this subject is about modelling and design: simply programming a solution will not get you a good mark.


## Other Information
We might need to use pull requests, just to make our collaboration easier. I suggest having a look through [this guide](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) to get an idea of how those work. We shouldn't directly push our changes onto the repository because if a problem arises, it might become really difficult to revert.

Try to make commits after any small change so it will be even easier to revert to a stable version.
